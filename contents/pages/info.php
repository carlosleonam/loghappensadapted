        <h5>Bug happens...</h5>
        <p>
            Every developer knows that. The nasty thing is that
            if you want to see what happened, you have to crawl between hundred
            lines log files, written in txt format, with no options to see them
            in an easier format, perhaps grouped by time.
        </p>

        <h5>That's why LogHappens exists!</h5>
        <p>
            LogHappens aims to fix this lack. It is a simple tool, it will not
            try to avoid writing bugs, but it will notify you immediately when
            something has been logged by your web server or your favorite
            framework.
        </p>

        <h5>Does it handle different log formats?</h5>
        <p>
            Of course it does. While it is true that every software has its own
            bugs, every software have its own way of logging things too. This is
            why I have tried to make it as simple as possible to let you create
            your own routine for reading log files. No fancy regex strings: if
            you just want to read the file, you can group log entries by date/time
            and print the rest of the file. If you are feeling adventurous, you
            can possibly do whatever you want: highlight words, create tags, split
            errors... the only limit is your fantasy.

        <h5>Any troubles?</h5>
